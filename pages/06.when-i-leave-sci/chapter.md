# When You Leave

There are a few reasons that could lead you to consider exporting your website content from Rutgers SC&I. Perhaps you’re leaving the University, or maybe you’re just wanting to use your data on another hosting environment. Whatever the case, you have a couple options for how you want to handle this:

If you are leaving the college, you can migrate your webspace from Rutgers SC&I to our hosting provider, Reclaim Hosting, for a discounted price.

If you would like to move to a third party service, you’ll want to capture a backup of your site. From there you’ll be able to import this backup into a handful of other web hosting services.

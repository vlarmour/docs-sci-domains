## Step One: Signing up for an Account
The first step will be to sign up for an account at Reclaim Hosting with their [Student/Individual Hosting plan](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=2) option.

* If you already have a Top-Level domain (i.e. yourdomain.com) choose the _I will use my existing domain and update my nameservers option_.
* If your current website content exists on a subdomain (i.e. yourdomain.rutgers-sci.domains), select the _Register a New Domain_ option. Then, enter a new top-level domain name.

Complete the sign-up process/pay invoice. If youâ€™d like to take advantage of a 10% discount, enter the promo code **reclaim4edu**.

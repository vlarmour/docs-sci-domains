Students, faculty, and staff of SC&I can request individual domains through the sign-up page.  Directions for requesting multiple domains (i.e., for students to use in a course) are provided further down.

##The Sign-Up Process
1. Go to the [SC&I Domains homepage](https://rutgers-sci.domains).
2. Click the "Get Started" Button
3. You will be redirected to login in for verification.  You will use your Rutgers NetID and password to log in.
4. Fill out the Request From.

Once your request is approved you will have access to a free domain (i.e., netid.rutgers-sci.domains).  Directions for purchasing a Top Level Domain (i.e., yourdomain.com) or connecting an existing domain are provided in the section Registering a Domain.

##Requesting Multiple Domains
Instructors can request domains for a course roster. [Email the SC&I IDTS team](https://idts.comminfo.rutgers.edu/contact/) with the following information:
* Attach the downloaded .csv file of your REGIS roster.
* Course name and number
* Date when domains are needed

Please share the link to this documentation with your students: http://docs.rutgers-sci.domains.  The IDTS team has provided suggested copy on the [IDTS website](https://comminfo.rutgers-sci.domains) for introducing students to SC&I Domains.  If you have any questions about using SC&I Domains with a course please [email the IDTS team](https://idts.comminfo.rutgers.edu/contact/).

Your ability to do things on SC&I Domains is dictated to a large degree by the limits of your imagination.  That said, there are some technical requirements and limitations that you should be aware of and might want to review.

To spark your imagination, here are some ideas that might help you get started:
##Install a Web Application in Your Space
SC&I Domains makes it very simple to install certain Web applications in your Web space.  Web applications are just special software that run on a web server.  Usually, they allow you to build and manage a website.  The kind of site you can build depends on the type of application you install.  Here are some examples of applications that you can easily install within the rutgers-sci.domains web hosting interface:
* **WordPress:** WordPress is a simple-to-use blogging application. The tool also comes with a huge array of plugins & themes to allow you to create virtually any kind of website imaginable. See the section on WordPress or check out the WordPress Playlist we put together on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/76115650?pathWildcard=76115650&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fcollections%2F6585172052146221057%3Fu%3D76115650).
* **Omeka:** Omeka is an open-source web application that can be used to create and display online digital collections and archives. We have a section in this documentation available to help you install and [use Omeka].
* **Scalar:** Scalar is a content management system with the idea of creating non-linear books on the web. You can learn more about its functions and how to install it in the Scalar section.
* **Grav:** Grav is an open source, flat-file CMS made for folks who are looking for something a little more experimental. Grav provides a straightforward framework for creating pages and inserting media. We have [additional resources for Grav] in the Popular Applications section. *Note: This documentation was created using Grav.*
* **Mediawiki:** It is the open-source wiki software that runs the online encyclopedia, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).  This tool may be right for you if you’re interested in publishing documents and then collaborating with others on them. Find our [guides on Mediawiki] in the Popular Applications section.

These are just a few of the open-source applications that are available to you in your SC&I Domains web space.  We encourage you to read more about what Web applications are and which ones are available to you through this project.

##Organize Your Site with Subdomains and Folders
Through this project, you’ve received a domain name that you can actually subdivide and organize anyway you like. One easy way to organize your domain is to [create subdomains], in which you can then install other applications. In addition, you can just set up subfolders for your site (which can also have their own applications installed in them). Here’s an example of how you might organize your site (using the subdomain vs. the subfolder approach.)

|	Subdomain Approach	|	Description	|	Subfolder Approach	|
|	------------------------		|	--------------	|	------------------------	|
|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains ("root")	|	Install WordPress as your “main site”	|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains ("root")	|
|	course1.netid.rutgers-sci.domains	|	Install a second WordPress instance for a course you’re taking	|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains/course1	|
|	photos.netid.rutgers-sci.domains	|	Install ZenPhoto for a public photo gallery of your photos	|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains/photos	|
|	docs.netid.rutgers-sci.domains	|	Install MediaWiki for a club you belong to that wants to collaboratively edit its bylaws	|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains/docs	|
|	files.netid.rutgers-sci.domains	|	Install OwnCloud so you can access your files on your laptop and at work	|	netid.rutgers-sci.domains/files	|

This is just an example of a way to organize your site and then use different sections to do different things. There is no one solution to this challenge, and what you do should be driven by what makes sense to you. To start, you may just want to install one thing at the “root” of your domain, and then let the rest evolve as you get to know more about what’s possible.

##Map Your Domain (or a Subdomain)
If you already have a digital presence that you’d like to pull into your SC&I Domains space, [domain mapping] is an option you may wish to explore. This allows you to assign your domain (or a subdomain) to another service. Some services that work with domain mapping are:
* [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)
* [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/)
* [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
* [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)

When you map a domain, users who visit your URL will automatically see your space on one of these services. It’s a great way to incorporate your activity elsewhere into your domain, and it might be a good first step if you’ve already established a presence somewhere else and just want to point your new domain to that space.

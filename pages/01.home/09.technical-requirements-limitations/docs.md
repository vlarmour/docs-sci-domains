Rutgers SC&I Domains uses a Web server known as a **LAMP server**. “LAMP” is an acronym for the technology stack that is installed on the server:
* **L**inux: This is the open-source operating system that is used on the server.
* **A**pache: This is the Web server software that the server uses.
* **M**ySQL: This is the database software that the server uses.
* **P**hp/Perl/Python: These are the three programming languages that the server can interpret.

Generally, if you are using applications available to install by default through the rutgers-sci.domains, you shouldn’t need to worry about these technical details. All of the software that is available for installation (in cPanel) meets the technical requirements.

If you’re interested in finding/installing another application (that isn’t available through our automatic installer tool), then you’ll have to be sure that the server can support it. To start with, you’ll want to be sure that the Web application can run on a LAMP server. Check the technical requirements for the application to determine this. You’ll also need to do some research about whether there are any additional services or modules required on the server. Some software may require components that aren’t included in the default installation of the LAMP stack. In that case, [contact us](support@reclaimhosting.com) with details about what you need, and we’ll see what we can do.
